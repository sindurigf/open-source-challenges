//   1. Have the gate audit every step a customer moves through, not only the homepage.
//   2. Find the navigation barrier that automated scanning has never reported.
//   3. Fix it and have the gate verify the fix holds.
//   4. Produce a report proving each customer journey step was audited and passes.
